# 03-Juicy-Match-3
Project 03 for MSCH-220

A Juicy Match 3 Game with some additional features from a base game. Some effects such as sound effects for the animal pieces are in there but not coded in due to some coding issues. Screen size is also too large but I have no idea how to fix it and it doesn't take away from any functionality of the overall game.

# Implementation
Created Using Godot

Added: Music, screenshake, custom tiles, particles, falling elements, rotating elements, particles. Attempted to add sound effects but code would not work.
